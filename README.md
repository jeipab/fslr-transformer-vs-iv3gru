# Filipino Sign Language Recognition Tool

This repository contains the implementation of our thesis project:
**Comparison of IV3-GRU and Transformer Models for Filipino Sign Language Recognition**.

## Repository Structure

- `preprocessing/` → keypoint extraction and occlusion handling
- `models/` → model architectures (IV3-GRU, Transformer)
- `training/` → training scripts, utilities, evaluation
- `ui/` → Streamlit demo application
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for experiments

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fsl-recognition-tool.git
cd fsl-recognition-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
